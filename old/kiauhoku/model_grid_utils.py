Python utilities designed to interact with output model grids from the Yale
Rotating stellar Evolution Code (YREC, Demarque et al. 2008). The grid of
models that accompany this software were produced by van Saders & 
Pinsonneault (2013) and updated by Claytor et al. (2019, in prep) using Castelli & 
Kurucz (2004) model atmospheres, which tabulate opacity information for various
metallicities and allow for alpha-enhancement. The rotation code within YREC
assumes a stellar-wind-driven braking law, and specific details on braking
parameters can be found in the file `braking_law_parameters.txt`.

These models span the following mass, metallicity, and alpha-enhancement
(grid parameters can be changed in `config.py`):

              |  min | max | step
    -----------------------------
      M/Msun  |  0.3 | 2.0 | 0.01
      [M/H]   | -1.0 | 0.5 | 0.5
    [alpha/M] |  0.0 | 0.4 | 0.4
    -----------------------------

According to Castelli & Kurucz (2004), [M/H] is log10(Z/Zsun), and 
alpha includes O, Ne, Mg, Si, S, Ar, Ca, and Ti.

The YREC output files have the format `met_###_alpha_###.out`, where ###
specifies the metallicity and alpha-enhancement for the models therein. The
formatting is such that met_-050_alpha_040.out corresponds to the set of tracks
with [M/H] = -0.5 and [alpha/M] = 0.4. Any given `.out` file contains an
evolution track for every mass in the grid. More details on these `.out` files
can be found in the files themselves.
